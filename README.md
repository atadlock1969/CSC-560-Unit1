Even though I started my IT career as a developer, it is not quite what I love about IT. I love understanding what a technology can do and leading folks who are much smarter than me to implement solutions. So, it takes much work for me to get the concepts of programming languages, platforms, etc.  I struggle with learning how a platform or a language works. After the installation of the node.js and a syntax error that was hard to see like two underlines before “dirname,” the real gotcha was comprehending the node package manager and what it was such that there was a difference between “express” and “expression.” I entered “expression” per the screen shot on slide 34 for the installation step. It took me a while with a couple of on-line videos later and the ah-ha from a Naveen Reddy clip to realize that if I install “express” my error on not finding “express” would be addressed. After two hours of frustration, I needed to sleep on it to then go down the path of learning more on npm to grasp my problem.

The other oddity was the fact that the server session needed to be restarted, at least on my laptop each time I changed the server.js code with the API endpoint updates. One point I shut down the server and nothing happened. It did not take long to realize, I shutdown the server. At least it came natural to me that some servers need a restart for a change to be applied to the system. 

Not sure I am grasping Postman, but found it simple to test the server.js . I will need more time to be comfortable with GIThub and node.js. 

All and all, I believe my code works. It did take me 8-10 hours to get use to the tools and to get the server.js working with npm via a little help from someone who is smarter than me (Naveen Reddy) and his videos as well as information from my favorite site, tutorialspoint.com. 

Above all the struggles do help me learn better.
